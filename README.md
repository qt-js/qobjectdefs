This module contains the `qobjectdefs.h` file used by the binding generation step of Qt.js to help properly parse MOC macros.

The file, GPL-3.0-only + Qt Company GPL Exception 1.0 licensed, is imported from the Qt Creator repo:

https://github.com/qt-creator/qt-creator/blob/ce032552c0df8306eefa55bc049b694762e334fa/share/qtcreator/cplusplus/wrappedQtHeaders/QtCore/qobjectdefs.h

And the version of this package will match the version of Qt-Creator I grabbed it from. I will also attempt to copy over commit history from the main repo.

The TypeScript/JavaScript file at the root of this module is licensed under the MIT license.
